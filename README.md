# Mod: Show Combat Encounter Detail
This mod shows combat encounter information when hovering them :
- Health
- Skills
- Items & item description  

The mod is still a work in progress I've spent a lot of hours on this.  
This mod is based on [`The Bazaar: Cheat Sheet`](https://jade-dead-e8e.notion.site/The-Bazaar-Cheat-Sheet-13531ff9bda580e19a10c96bb6d9e346#13831ff9bda580a4b8e3d1da20ab4576)
