# Mod: Show Combat Encounter Detail
This mod shows combat encounter information when hovering them :
- Health
- Skills
- Items & item description  

The mod is still a work in progress I've spent a lot of hours on this.  
This mod is based on [`The Bazaar: Cheat Sheet`](https://jade-dead-e8e.notion.site/The-Bazaar-Cheat-Sheet-13531ff9bda580e19a10c96bb6d9e346#13831ff9bda580a4b8e3d1da20ab4576)

## Install
- ### Mod loader
  If you never launched/did an update/reinstalled the game, launch it at least once before continuing (just get to the main menu that's all)  
  Download [BepInEx 6.0.0-pre.2 x64](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v6.0.0-pre.2/BepInEx-Unity.Mono-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2.zip) (windows)  , [(for non windows, use x64 and mono)](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx
)  
   Extract in the games root folder (usually `C:\Program Files\Tempo Launcher - Beta\The Bazaar game_64\bazaarwinprodlatest`)  
   Before continuing launch the game and a new console window should appear, if not you did the install wrong
- ### Mod Install
  Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Infarcactus/Mod-The-Bazaar-Show-Combat-Encounter-Detail/releases) (not the source code)  
  Extract it in `BepInEx\plugins` (in your game files)
  If you did everything properly in `C:\Program Files\Tempo Launcher - Beta\The Bazaar game_64\bazaarwinprodlatest\BepInEx\plugins` you should see a folder named `ShowCombatEncounterDetail`

## Uninstall
- Go to your game folder and `BepInEx\plugins`
- Delete `ShowCombatEncounterDetail` folder
